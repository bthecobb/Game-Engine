|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| ECS Core | 6 | 100% | ✅ Production-ready |
| Transform System | 4 | 100% | ✅ Production-ready |
| Physics Integration | 4 | 100% | ✅ Production-ready |
| Rendering | 4 | 75% | ⚠️ Minor fixes needed |
| Camera Systems | 4 | 0% | 🔧 Fixes in progress |

**Overall:** 79.17% pass rate (19/24 tests passing)

### Systematic Debugging Process

**Problem:** 7 critical bugs causing test failures and crashes

**My Approach:**
1. **TestDebugger Utility** - Built custom debugging tool
   - Entity/component state dumps
   - System initialization tracking
   - Per-test execution logs
   
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Documented every bug
   - Symptoms, reproduction steps
   - Root cause identification
   - Fix implementation and validation
   
3. **Sprint-Based Workflow** - Professional project management
   - Kanban board with backlog, in-progress, done
   - Velocity tracking (7 bugs fixed in Sprint 1)
   - Milestone planning toward 95% pass rate

**Results:**
- Fixed 7 critical bugs (component lifetime, system initialization, PhysX integration)
- Improved test pass rate from ~50% to 79%
- Created 5,000+ lines of technical documentation
