## Working Directory
- Current Directory: C:\Users\Brandon\CudaGame\build

## Actions Taken:

1. **Reviewed Previous Session:**
   - Assessed the session summary and technical details from the previous session to understand the current state of the engine.
   - Confirmed the successful fix of the PBR texture binding issue in `RenderSystem.cpp`.
   - Verified the addition of a more robust test scene in `GameEngine.cpp`.

2. **Analyzed UI System:**
   - Investigated the incomplete `UIRenderer` class and the `renderDebugHUD` function.
   - Identified that the `UIRenderer` is not functional and the `renderDebugHUD` function is not correctly implemented.

3. **Formulated a New Plan:**
   - Developed a new plan to implement a simple, functional debug HUD.
   - The new plan involves removing the existing `UIRenderer` and implementing a self-contained debug HUD within the `GameEngine` class.

## Next Steps:
1. **Implement a Functional Debug HUD:**
   - A simple, self-contained debug HUD will be added to the `GameEngine` class to provide real-time debugging information.
2. **Verify on-screen results:**
   - Once the HUD is implemented, the next step will be to run the application and confirm that the debug information is being displayed correctly. This will also serve to visually confirm that the renderer is working as expected.
3. **Continue Engine Development:**
   - With a functional renderer and a debug HUD, the engine will be in a much better state for continued development. The next steps will be to either continue with the original plan of implementing a more advanced UI system or to begin work on other features, such as gameplay mechanics or a more advanced asset pipeline.

This document tracks the new plan for the immediate work required to get a functional debug HUD running.
